I'm just going to say it. This is a *good McDonald's. Anybody complaining about the wait time or service should know better than to visit during peak hours when everyone wants their dollar cone or Crocs Happy Meal.
Pretty much nothing is open late in Kerrisdale. This is the saving grace. Food: hot. Ice cream portions: *fantastic. Cleanliness: as good as Ronald gets (bathroom is *good enough). I approve of this McDonald's.
